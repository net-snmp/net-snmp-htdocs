the local device and should be suitable for use in commands
entered at the device's `console'.  This might be a text
name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1',
depending on the interface naming syntax of the device.  If
several entries in the ifTable together represent a single
interface as named by the device, then each will have the
same value of ifName.  Note that for an agent which responds
to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other
(proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an
interface is the proxied device's local name for it.

If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not

<pre>
This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as
specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile
'handle' for the interface.

On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of
ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length
string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of
ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the
agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
associated with the same interface for as long as that
interface remains instantiated, including across all re-
initializations/reboots of the network management system,
including those which result in a change of the interface's
ifIndex value.

An example of the value which a network manager might store
in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit
number/identifier of the interface.

Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces
having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports
write access to this object is required to keep the value in
non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
values depending on how much storage is already occupied by
the current values for other interfaces.

no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re-

The table containing information on the relationships
between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces.  In
particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run
'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer
corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over
the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table
contains:

  ifStackStatus.x.y=active

For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active
interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
in this table associated with I.  For one of these rows, I
is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the
value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If I is not involved in
multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
with I.)

For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has
no others stacked on top or below it:

<pre>
This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
a prior test is active on another interface.

Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

          try_again:
  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
  while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
      /*
       * Loop while a test is running or some other
       * manager is configuring a test.
       */
      short delay
      get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
  }

  /*
   * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
   * to see who gets it.
   */
  lock_value = ifTestId

  if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
           ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
      /*
       * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
       * try again
       */
      goto try_again;

  /*
   * I have the lock
   */
  set up any test parameters.

  /*
   * This starts the test
   */
  set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

  wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

  when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
       agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

  retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

  if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

A manager station first retrieves the value of the
appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
the ifTestEntry.

Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
a possibility that the first test's results might be
overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first

results being read.  This unlikely circumstance ca

A control variable used to start and stop operator-
initiated interface tests.  Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values
assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with
specific types of interface.  However, this document assigns
a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the
special meanings of the subject identifier:

    noTest  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 }

When the value noTest is written to this object, no action
is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the
test is aborted.  Writing any other value to this object is

only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which
case the indicated test is initiated.

When read, this object always returns the most recent value
that ifTestType was set to.  If it has not been set since
the last initialization of the network management subsystem
on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.

<tr><td><a name="TestAndIncr">TestAndIncr</td><td>INTEGER</td><td><pre>Represents integer-valued information used for atomic
operations.  When the management protocol is used to specify
that an object instance having this syntax is to be
modified, the new value supplied via the management protocol
must precisely match the value presently held by the
instance.  If not, the management protocol set operation
fails with an error of `inconsistentValue'.  Otherwise, if
the current value is the maximum value of 2^31-1 (2147483647
decimal), then the value held by the instance is wrapped to
zero; otherwise, the value held by the instance is
incremented by one.  (Note that regardless of whether the
management protocol set operation succeeds, the variable-
binding in the request and response PDUs are identical.)

The value of the ACCESS clause for objects having this
syntax is either `read-write' or `read-create'.  When an
instance of a columnar object having this syntax is created,
any value may be supplied via the management protocol.

When the network management portion of the system is re-
initialized, the value of every object instance having this
syntax must either be incremented from its value prior to
the re-initialization, or (if the value prior to the re-
initialization is unknown) be set to a pseudo-randomly

creation and deletion of conceptual rows, and is used as the
value of the SYNTAX clause for the status column of a
conceptual row (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [2].)

The status column has six defined values:

     - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
     available for use by the managed device;

     - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
     row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
     the managed device (see NOTE below); 'notInService' has
     no implication regarding the internal consistency of
     the row, availability of resources, or consistency with
     the current state of the managed device;

     - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
     exists in the agent, but is missing information
     necessary in order to be available for use by the
     managed device (i.e., one or more required columns in
     the conceptual row have not been instanciated);

     - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
     to active, making it available for use by the managed
     device;

     - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
     station wishing to create a new instance of a
     conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
     the managed device); and,
     - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station
     wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
     an existing conceptual row.

Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may
be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
three values will be returned in response to a management
protocol retrieval operation:  `notReady', `notInService' or
`active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
has only three states:  it is either available for use by
the managed device (the status column has value `active');
it is not available for use by the managed device, though
the agent has sufficient information to attempt to make it
so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is
not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt
to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
information (the state column has value `notReady').

                         NOTE WELL

     This textual convention may be used for a MIB table,
     irrespective of whether the values of that table's
     conceptual rows are able to be modified while it is
     active, or whether its conceptual rows must be taken
     out of service in order to be modified.  That is, it is
     the responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
     status column to specify whether the status column must
     not be `active' in order for the value of some other
     column of the same conceptual row to be modified.  If
     such a specification is made, affected columns may be
     changed by an SNMP set PDU if the RowStatus would not
     be equal to `active' either immediately before or after
     processing the PDU.  In other words, if the PDU also
     contained a varbind that would change the RowStatus
     value, the column in question may be changed if the
     RowStatus was not equal to `active' as the PDU was
     received, or if the varbind sets the status</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="InterfaceIndexOrZero">InterfaceIndexOrZero</td><td>INTEGER32</td><td><pre>This textual convention is an extension of the
InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced.</pre></td></tr>
